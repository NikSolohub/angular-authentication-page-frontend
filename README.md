    Feature branch : feature/<name>
    Fix branch : fix/<name> or hfix/name

## <a name="commits"></a> Commits

    Commits need to be small enough.

    Commit prefixes:

    Feat - new feature was created
    WIP - 'work in progress' commit for unfinished task/feature.
    Add - sources were added
    Upd - sources were updated
    Fix - source/feature bug was fixed at development
    Hfix - source/feature bug was fixed at product
    Refactor - a code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    Docs - documentation only changes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
